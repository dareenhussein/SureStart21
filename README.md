Reflections

Day 1: February 8, 2021

I am very delighted and thrilled to be joining this year cohort of the program. Itâ€™s my first time attending actual workshops and seminars about Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I hope that by the end of this program I more knowledgable and skilled in other fields with a fruitful environment of expertise and mentors. I aim to end this program with more confidence in talking and getting deeper in such important topics as ML and AI especially that I ma taking a deep learning course this semester in my university too.

Question 1-What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
For the supervised learning the program has a training dataset with labels that then apply the ML algprithm to to train the model on to predict results, while on the other hand the unsupervised program has no training examples and hence depends on the unsupervised ML algorithms to best find patterns and relationships between the data.

Question 2-Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries:
The Scikit-Learn is a ML library that is needed for statistical data modeling but not in their visual representation. Therefore, it is used beside other libraries like Graphviz and Pandas, to visualize and manipulate the data.
